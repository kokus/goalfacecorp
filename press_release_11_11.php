              <p>WASHINGTON, DC USA.
11/11/2011-- GoalFace.com (<a href="http://www.goalface.com/">www.goalface.com</a>)
is the premier online destination for football worldwide. GoalFace is a
web-based platform that is 100% dedicated
to football, delivering the latest from professional leagues and tournaments
across Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia–anytime, everywhere, on demand.
Anyone with an interest in football can experience the excitement of a
real-time, community-centered site with 1,000,000+ pages of content and people
as passionate about the game as they are regardless of which players, teams or
leagues they follow.  With its <i>Football Everywhere</i> mission, GoalFace
strives to bring professional football from around the world to members of the
global football community in a fun and easy-to-use format everywhere they are.</p>

<img src="images/gflogo.png" alt="GoalFace" style="float: right;">
              
              <p>"As professional football has become increasingly global
fans have found it more difficult to keep up with their favorite players, teams
and leagues worldwide," says Co-Founder and President John Gakau. "GoalFace
makes it easy for fans and others in the global football community, including
bloggers, members of the media, scouts, agents and football industry
stakeholders, to keep up with the players, teams and leagues they care about
most through a customizable web site and notifications platforms that deliver
scores, schedules, real-time updates, news and other information when and where
they want them."</p>

<p>With GoalFace, members of the
global football community can:</p>
              
              <ul>
              	<li><em>Follow their favorite players and teams everywhere, in real time.</em> GoalFace delivers live updates for 100,000+ professional players and teams around the world right to the user.  Every player and team has a multi-page profile that includes live updates, photography, career statistics, editorial and user-generated content available on the web site.</li>
                
                <li><em>Keep up with their favorite leagues and tournaments.</em> GoalFace provides access to news, schedules, scores, and coverage of games, including matches from the World Cup, Champions League, Copa Libertadores and hundreds of other professional leagues and tournaments across Africa, the Americas, Europe and Asia via the web site, email updates, Facebook, iGoogle, Netvibes, mobile phone and elsewhere online. </li>
                <li><em>Personalize their experience.</em> After registering on GoalFace.com, members can personalize the site experience to focus on those players, teams, leagues and tournaments they care about most, with the entire world of football still just a few clicks away.</li>

              <p>All of this and much more are available for free in an easy to use web experience that is 100% football!</p>
              
              <p>The idea for GoalFace grew out of its founders' love for football. Unsatisfied with the available options, the founders set out to build an information and community experience that would do justice to the game that they and hundreds of millions of others around the world are so passionate about. </p>
              
              <p>"Tournaments like World Cup, Copa America, Champions League and Africa Nations Cup are the most prestigious competitions in football, but they represent only a part of the global game," says Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer Jorge Vasquez. "GoalFace brings the richness and vibrancy of the professional game from leagues and tournaments around the world, to complement the spectacle of those grand tournaments and complete the picture. But perhaps the best thing about GoalFace is the opportunity it provides to follow, learn, connect and talk football with others around the world&#8212;anytime, everywhere, on demand." </p>
