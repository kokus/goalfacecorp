                        <h3>Use of Share Links by Online Content Providers</h3>
                        
                        <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of
                        these Terms of Service, Third Party sites that meet the requirements
                        set forth below may place a Share Link (as described below), in the
                        form approved by Company, on pages of their web sites to facilitate
                        use of the Share service. A Third Party site that posts a Share Link
                        on its web site is referred to herein as an &quot;Online Content Provider&quot;
                        and shall abide and be subject to the applicable sections of these Terms
                        of Service. A &quot;Share Link&quot; is a button and/or a text link
                        appearing on an Online Content Provider&#39;s web page that, upon being
                        clicked by a user, enables us to launch a sharing mechanism through
                        which users can share with others or post to their own member profile,
                        links and content from that page. </p>

                        <p>In the event that the Share Link
                        is a button that contains any icons or other graphic images, trademarks
                        or other proprietary materials of the Company, Online Content Provider
                        is granted permission to use such images, trademarks or other materials
                        solely for the purpose of placing the Share Link on Online Content Provider&#39;s
                        site and solely in the current form provided by the Company. In the
                        event that the Share Link is a text link, it must include the word &quot;GoalFace&quot;
                        as part of the link. The rights granted in this paragraph may be revoked
                        by Company at any time with or without cause in its sole discretion,
                        and upon such termination, Online Content Provider agrees to immediately
                        remove all Share Links from its site.</p>

                        
                        <p>In order for an Online Content Provider
                        to include a Share Link on its pages, the Third Party site must not
                        contain any web content that if shared or posted by a user would be
                        a violation of the user conduct rules set forth above. Without limiting
                        the forgoing, Online Content Provider agrees not to post a Share Link
                        on any web site that contains, and represents and warrants that such
                        web site does not and will not contain, any content that is infringing,
                        harmful, threatening, unlawful, defamatory, abusive, inflammatory, harassing,
                        vulgar, obscene, lewd, fraudulent, or invasive of privacy or publicity
                        rights or that may expose Company or its users to any harm or liability
                        of any type. Upon including of a Share Link, Online Content Provider
                        agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the Company, its subsidiaries and
                        affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, agents, contractors,
                        partners and employees, harmless from and against any loss, liability,
                        claim, demand, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney&#39;s
                        fees, arising out of or in connection with such Share Link, any links,
                        content or other items or materials which may be shared or posted through
                        such Share Link, or any breach or alleged breach of the foregoing representations
                        and warranties.</p>
                         
                        <p>By including a Share Link, Online
                        Content Provider automatically grants, and represents and warrants that
                        it has the right to grant, to the Company an irrevocable, perpetual,
                        non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the
                        right to sublicense) to use the Share service in order to link to, use,
                        copy, publish, stream, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat,
                        translate, excerpt (in whole or in part), summarize, and distribute
                        the content, links and other materials of any kind residing on any web
                        pages on which Online Content Provider places the Share Link.</p>

                        to be excessive in a consumer dispute, the Company will be responsible
