					<h3>The GoalFace Starting 11</h3>
				
					<p>We’re a group of guys (sorry, no gals yet) working to create a better online experience for the global football community.</p>
					<p>Like most football fans in the past, we had to go to several web sites to find news, scores, stats and other information about the players, leagues and tournaments we cared about. Recognizing that millions of others  shared our frustration, we  created GoalFace to bring the action from professional football pitches around the world to them in real time; all the while connecting and engaging the globall football community around the passion and magic of the sport they love. </p>
                    
					<p>The GoalFace team has brought together scores, pictures, news, statistics and other information from 200+ leagues and tournaments from around the world into a place that is user-friendly and 100% football. With GoalFace, the millions  who make up the global football community no longer have to waste time searching multiple sources across the web to get the information  they want or to find each other. GoalFace is the place that brings it all together for the global football community &ndash;anytime, everywhere, on demand.</p>
                    
                    <p>We hope you like site, and appreciate  any <a hre="contactus.php">feedback and suggestions</a> you have to  make GoalFace the best place for football online.</p>
                    
                    
					<p>Cheers!<br/>
					The GoalFace Team <p/>
